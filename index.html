          The Lagrange Polynomials associated to a set of \(x_i\) are : \(l_i(X) = \prod_{j=0,j\neq 1}^n \frac{X-x_j}{x_i-x_j}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, you can see the lagrange polynomials associated to a set of three points, and move the \(x_i\) around to see the effect it has on all the polynomials.

        <p>
          We see that the polynomials indeed respect the properties :
          \(deg(l_i)=n,\forall i\) and \(l_i(x_i)=\delta_{i,j},0\leq i,j\leq n\), meaning that \(l_i(x_i)=1\) and \(l_i(x_j)=0\) when \(j\neq i\)
        </p>

        <p>
          An interesting property (by design) of these polynomials is that any linear combination \(\sum_i c_il_i(X)\) will have value \(c_i\) at \(x_i\), and the resulting polynomial will be the lowest degree one to go through all those points.
          Our initial function \(f\) is therefore quite well approximated by the polynomial \(\sum_if_il_i(X)\)
